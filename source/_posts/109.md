在很多 RESTfull 应用中，会使用到POST 方法去创建内容， PUT 方法去更新内容，例如

```
curl -x PUT /user/1 --data username=zonghua
```

但是经常混淆的是 PUT 和 PATCH 方法，从字面意义上理解就是，PUT 是重新放置， PATCH 进行局部修改。

当使用 id 做唯一主键的时候，就是 PUT 方法将一个指定 id 对象进行完全替换， PATCH 方法指定 id 去更新这个对象。

RFC 标准 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#page-2
>  The difference between the PUT and PATCH requests is reflected in the
   way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource
   identified by the Request-URI.  In a PUT request, the enclosed entity
   is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the
   origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version
   be replaced.  With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set
   of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the
   origin server should be modified to produce a new version.  The PATCH
   method affects the resource identified by the Request-URI, and it
   also MAY have side effects on other resources; i.e., new resources
   may be created, or existing ones modified, by the application of a
   PATCH.
